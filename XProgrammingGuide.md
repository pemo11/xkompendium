# The little X# programming guide

Disclaimer: This is not a complete guide neither a rehash of the official X# documentation.

So what is it? Its a light introduction to the X# language by using examples instead of textual descriptions.

Please always refer to the X# documentation for any reference or if you are in doubt about anything written in this document.

##Naming conventions

This topic is really hard because there is no official naming convention and if you ask developers about the conventions you will probably get two kind of ansers:

1. We don't use any conventions
2. We use our own conventions

I think we can all (hopefully) agree that using the good old _Hungaring notation_ is not something that fits for being in the 21st century.
